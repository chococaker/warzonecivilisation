This game runs a lot on IDs. Here's a simple guide:

Each ID has two parts:
 - meta-definition
 - name

The meta-definition part is concatenated with the '@' symbol to prevent any confusion.
Here's what makes up the meta-definition:
{type of thing being ID-ed}{three letters of mod}

First of all, the type of thing being IDed is one letter representing what is being IDed, being one
of the following things:
 - system (s)
 - object prefab (a)
 - player prefab (b)
 - event (e)
 - event error (r)
 - object component (o)
 - player component (p)

Secondly is three characters of representing the mod being implemented. For example,
 - 'ems' for a mod called "Epic Monsters"
 - 'ltr' for a mod called "Lord of the Rings"
 - '912' for a mod called "912 Fixes"

Next comes the name. This is just a name for the system, object, component, etc. of what you are
IDing. For example, a health component may be named "health."

EXAMPLES OF IDS
 - 'sjon@attack' might represent an attack system under "Jon's Mod"
 - 'opj7@unicorn' might represent a unicorn component under "Pajamas7's Fantasy Creatures"
 - 'acho@cake_trader' might represent a cake-trading object prefab under "chococaker's Cake Trader"

These IDs are CONVENTIONS created in order to prevent conflicts with other mods Unless your mod is
meant to be standalone and is too large to uphold these conventions without messy things happening,
it is highly recommended to comply with these conventions.

Also, "000" is an identifier associated with the vanilla codebase. Avoid using this identifier as
your own.
