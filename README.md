# Warzone Civilisation
Don't mind the name-- this project was supposed to be a game, but it slowly turned into a board
game management library.

As of right now, it's a bit of a mess.

This project features a de-centralised ECS (aka there is no central ECS manager, instead more
similar to modding tools such as Minecraft Bukkit) with an event framework. Currently in the
process of adding some example systems in order to test the framework.
